# Real-Time Traffic Tweet Categorization

This repository contains a project for real-time categorization of traffic-related tweets. The goal is to classify tweets based on their content, providing useful insights for traffic monitoring and management. The project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to achieve accurate categorization.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Streaming:** Integration with Twitter API to fetch live tweets.
- **Tweet Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preprocessing tweets to remove noise.
- **Categorization:** Classifying tweets into categories such as accidents, road closures, traffic jams, and weather-related issues.
- **Visualization:** Real-time dashboard to visualize categorized tweets and traffic trends.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently.

## Components

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Scripts to connect to Twitter API and stream live tweets.
   - Storage solutions for archiving raw tweets.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Tokenization and normalization of tweet text.
   - Removal of stop words, hashtags, mentions, and URLs.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Supervised learning models (e.g., SVM, Naive Bayes Classifier, Decision Tree) for initial tweet categorization.
   - Advanced model training using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

4. **Real-Time Processing:**
   - Integration with a streaming platform (e.g., Apache Kafka) for real-time data ingestion.
   - Deployment of trained models for real-time tweet classification.

5. **Dashboard:**
   - Interactive dashboard built with tools like Power BI or Tableau.
   - Visual representation of categorized tweets and traffic patterns.

## Handling Sequences with LSTM

While initial models like SVM, Naive Bayes Classifier, and Decision Tree are used for basic tweet categorization, the project also employs LSTM networks to leverage the sequential nature of tweet data. Here are the advantages of using LSTM:

- **Handling Sequences:** LSTM models can capture the sequential nature of text data more effectively than SVM.
- **Context Understanding:** LSTMs can maintain context over long sequences, making them suitable for understanding nuanced patterns in text.
- **Feature Learning:** Unlike SVM, which relies on predefined features (TF-IDF), LSTMs can learn features directly from the raw text data.
